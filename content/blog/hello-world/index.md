This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.

```ts
export const createPages: GatsbyCreatePages = async ({
  graphql,
  boundActionCreators,
}) => {
  const { createPage } = boundActionCreators;

  const allMarkdown = await graphql(`
    {
      allMarkdownRemark(
        sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }
        limit: 1000
      ) {
        edges {
          node {
            fields {
              slug
            }
            frontmatter {
              title
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `);

  if (allMarkdown.errors) {
    throw allMarkdown.errors;
  }

  // Create blog posts pages.
  const posts = allMarkdown.data.allMarkdownRemark.edges;

  posts.forEach((post: Post, index: number) => {
    const previous = index === posts.length - 1 ? null : posts[index + 1].node;
    const next = index === 0 ? null : posts[index - 1].node;
    createPage({
      path: post.node.fields.slug,
      // tslint:disable-next-line:object-literal-sort-keys
      component: path.resolve(`./src/templates/blog-post.tsx`),
      context: {
        next,
        previous,
        slug: post.node.fields.slug,
      },
    });
  });

  return null;
};
```
